## OWASP DPD Project Roadmap 
The below steps are just a summary of the steps we will take in this project.
*Note: details of steps will be published till next week. 

****What is Deep Packet Inspection, Medium Packet Inspection and Shallow Packet Inspection?**

* Difference between SPI, MPI and DPI.

* Important dimensions in traffic analysis.

* Traffic analysis with Deep Packet Inspection techniques and Micro-Analysis mechanism.

* Learning open source tools for traffic analysis and DPI.

****Explanation and investigation of network traffic attack.**

* What is the impact of DDoS attacks ? 

* How we can detect it using traffic analysis methods such as SPI, MPI, DPI, MA etc ?

* Deep analysis of all the network traffic attacks methods in Layer 3.

* Deep analysis of all the network traffic attacks methods in Layer 4.

* Deep analysis of all the network traffic attacks methods in Layer 7.

****How we can prevent against DDoS Attacks?**

* Full explanation of DAQ's, Conntrack and Hardware Offloaded techniques.

* Full explanation of Kernel, CPU, Memory and NPU work cycles.

* Complete explanation of Packet Processing libraries.

* Implementation of all packet processing libraries and accurate evaluation in the use of system resources against traffic attacks.

* Write down Signature to deal with Attacks Based on Patterns Extracted in the Traffic Analysis stage. (We will write signatures of all methods using Snort, Openappid, ebpf and Luajit)


****Simulate DDoS attack methods one by one and check the performance of our DDoS Mitigation Box.**
