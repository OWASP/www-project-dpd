## What is the DPD?

Due to the increase DDOS attacks, the change of old methods of this type of attack to new methods and also by studying the vulnerability of services against these attacks, I decided to design a project for free in order to prevent this type of Attacks using DPI  and accurate network traffic analysis. In this project, we will first look at the steps and how to analyze network traffic to find suspicious behaviors and detect attacks, from beginner to advanced levels.In this project, we will analyze more than 150 types of old and new traffic attacks used by attackers step by step and explain the analysis methods in detail. We will also explain in detail how to create a traffic analysis laboratory. Then we explain the methods of dealing with this type of attack using the patterns extracted in the traffic analysis step. In fact, we look at ways to deal with all 150 types of attacks using open source tools such as snorts,oppenappid,Lua Programming and etc. finally, by simulating the same attacks, we make sure that our security strategies are working properly. Given the concerns of many security professionals in the face of such attacks, we can make a great and valuable contribution to all of them by making this project public.We will also analyze the new methods used by the attackers from year to year and publish strategies to deal with them in the new version of the project at the end of the year. In this project, we will also look at the methods used by attackers to bypass the DDOS Service Providers signature .
