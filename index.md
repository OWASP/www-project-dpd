## What is the DPD?
The OWASP DDoS Prevention using DPI (DPD) Project includes  Methods, Strategies, Documents and Programs to dealing against DDoS attacks using Deep Packet Inspection, Medium Packet Inspection and Shallow Packet Inspection.
Due to the increase of DDoS attacks, the change of old methods to new methods and also By examining the degree of impact of services against these type of attacks, we decided to lunch a project in order to prevent this type of Attacks using **Deep Packet Inspection**  and **Accurate Network Traffic Analysis**. In this project, we will first look at the steps and how to analyse network traffic to find suspicious behaviours to detect attacks, we will also analyse more than 150 types of old and new methods which is used by attackers' step by step, and we will explain the analysis methods in detail. In the next chapter We will explain in detail how to create a traffic analysis laboratory. Then we explain and examine  the methods of dealing with this type of attack using the patterns which is extracted in the traffic analysis step. In fact, we look at ways to deal with all 150 types of attacks using open source tools such as snorts, oppenappid, Lua Programming etc. finally, by simulating the same attacks, we make sure that our security strategies are working properly. At the end we will release an OWASP DPD.  We will also analyse the new methods used by the attackers from year to year and publish strategies to deal with them in the new version of the project at the end of the year. In this project, we will also look at the methods used by attackers to bypass the DDoS Service Providers signatures.
